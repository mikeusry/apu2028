## Why Amelia's Advice Matters

She wasn't a top-ranked 5-star recruit. She's 5'3", was overlooked for her size, and went through the full gauntlet of the recruiting process. She worked the system systematically and now shares what actually worked.

## The 12 Recruiting Myths (Truth Bombs)

### Myth #1: "You can commit whenever you're ready"

**FALSE.** The fall recruiting window is REAL.

- Winter off-season: Nothing
- High school season: Nothing
- Summer: Coaches already chasing the next class

**Reality:** There are windows, and once they close, opportunities disappear.

### Myth #2: "The name on your jersey doesn't matter"

**Partially true**, but people usually say this to make you feel better if you're not on a team in the "recruiting bubble."

**Reality:** Team placement matters for visibility. Stars National Walker IS in the bubble.

### Myth #3: "Stats don't matter to coaches"

**FALSE.** Coaches DO look at stats and bring them up in calls.

**Action:** Track stats meticulously. Ayn's .380/.438/.922 line matters.

## Size & Getting Overlooked

If undersized (like Ayn at 5'7", or Amelia at 5'3"):

> **Must OVERWHELM with metrics**

- Need ONE undeniable tool
- For Ayn: Speed + high OBP contact hitting
- Measurable metrics trump size concerns

## The 10 Rules (From Her Book)

### Rule #8: Grades Can Be a Game Changer or Deal Breaker

Academics matter more than most athletes realize. They can open doors at schools that might otherwise overlook you, or slam them shut entirely.

**Ayn's advantage:** 3.74 GPA is a real differentiator.

### Rule #10: Loyalty Is Not Blind—It Must Go Both Ways

> "You don't owe your potential to the past. Real loyalty doesn't limit growth—it celebrates it. The right people cheer for you, even when your path changes."

---

## Camp & Showcase Strategy

**Don't waste money on camps that won't help you:**

> "It's not the wasted money... it's the time. Imagine how good all of us could be if we cut HALF the camps and showcases and used that time to focus on things that actually made us better."

**On mass camp emails:**

> "Don't send out a mass camp email invite to a class you've finished recruiting. That's just mean."

**Takeaway:** Be strategic. Research which camps actually have coach attendance for YOUR grad year. Use time saved from unnecessary camps to train.

## Work Ethic Requirements

From @JonKarcich (retweeted by Amelia):

> "News flash: If you want to play at the next level and you're not doing something productive 6x a week, you should reconsider."

From a D1 coach she shared:

> "If a high school player looks like a high school player, they don't get recruited."

**Translation:** You need to LOOK like you already belong at the next level. Train like a professional.

## The Junior Year Grind

Amelia posted a photo of herself exactly two years before her freshman year:

> "This was me exactly two years ago...exhausted, traveling nonstop, doing whatever it took during my junior-year recruiting journey. To all the athletes out there who were on the road every weekend, balancing school, sports, and airports... I see you!!!"

**This is normal.** The recruiting grind is real, exhausting, and necessary.

---

## The Hard Truth for Uncommitted Athletes

> "YOU ARE NOT ALONE!! In fact, there are waaaaaay more athletes in OUR shoes than not!"

Most athletes aren't committed early. Most go through the grind. The highlight reels on social media don't show the full picture.
