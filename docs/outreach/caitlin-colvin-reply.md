**Subject:** RE: Quick question about a product idea

---

Caitlin,

This is exactly what I needed to hear. The fact that you've already pitched this idea to others tells me the problem is real - not just something I'm seeing in a vacuum.

Two things jumped out:

**The mid-major insight is huge.** I was thinking about this from the family side (help them find schools), but you flipped it - mid-majors need help finding players who fall through the cracks. That's a two-sided opportunity I hadn't fully considered.

**The info-hoarding problem is real but solvable.** If travel orgs won't share because it's their competitive advantage, the play is going direct to families and working with coaches like you who actually want to help kids find the right fit - not just protect turf.

Your point about curated content vs. generic ChatGPT output is noted. Nobody needs another tool that spits out form letters. The value is in the personalization.

**Yes - please reach out to other coaches.** I'd love their perspective, especially anyone on the mid-major side who feels the pain of getting overlooked by good players. A few honest conversations would help shape what this actually needs to be.

I'll keep you posted as this develops. Appreciate you taking the time.

Mike
