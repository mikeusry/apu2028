# Softball Discovery Tool - Stars National Feedback Request

---

## For Joe Walker

**Subject:** Quick question - program discovery for families

Joe,

Between running Stars National and advising families on recruiting, you see something most people don't - how families actually make decisions about where to look.

I'm exploring building a tool to help with that discovery piece. Not another SportsRecruits profile site. Something that helps families **learn** about programs they've never heard of.

The problem I keep seeing:
- Families know the 20 schools on ESPN
- Travel coaches know maybe 50-100 programs well (their network)
- But there are 300+ D1 programs out there
- Result: good fits get missed because nobody knew they existed

The concept: A discovery platform with deep program profiles, smart search ("programs within 400 miles that develop contact hitters"), and real intel on culture, coaching philosophy, and recruiting patterns.

**Two questions:**

1. Would something like this be useful for Stars families, or is the current system (word of mouth + Google + camps) working fine?

2. Would coaches see it as helpful or would it step on what you already provide?

No agenda here - just trying to figure out if this is a real problem worth solving.

## For Coach Adrian Diaz

**Subject:** Program discovery tool - your thoughts?

Coach,

Quick question while I've got recruiting on the brain.

When families ask you "what schools should we look at?" - how often do you have a good answer vs. having to say "I don't know that program well"?

I'm thinking about building a tool that helps families discover and learn about programs beyond the obvious names. Deep profiles, smart search, culture/fit info - the stuff that's hard to Google.

The gap I keep seeing: services like SportsRecruits help with exposure, but nobody helps families actually **understand** programs. Everyone assumes you already know where you want to go.

**Would love your honest take:**

1. Is discovery actually a pain point for the families you work with?

2. If a tool like this existed, would it make your job easier when advising families on fit?

3. What info would actually be useful that doesn't exist today?

Rachel mentioned strength is Ayn's differentiator - I'm wondering if the same principle applies here. What would differentiate a recruiting tool that actually helps vs. the noise that's already out there?

Thanks for everything you do for these kids.

Mike
