## For Parents with Kids NOW in College (Hindsight Perspective)

**Subject:** Quick question about [DAUGHTER]'s recruiting journey

Hey [NAME],

Now that [DAUGHTER] is at [SCHOOL] and you've got some distance from the recruiting process, I'd love to pick your brain.

Looking back - how did you actually find the schools you looked at? Was it mostly word of mouth, travel coach connections, camps, Google?

I'm exploring building a tool to help families discover programs they've never heard of. Not another profile site - something that actually educates families about programs. Culture, coaching philosophy, what they look for, whether it's a good fit.

**A few questions if you have 5 minutes:**

1. How many programs did you seriously look at vs. how many did you even know existed?

2. Was there anything you wish you'd known earlier about [SCHOOL] or other programs you considered?

3. If you could go back, what information would have made the process easier?

4. Did you ever feel like you were just guessing about whether a program was a good fit?

No sales pitch - genuinely trying to figure out if this is a real problem. You've been through it, so your perspective matters.

Thanks,
Mike

## For Parents Currently Recruiting (In the Trenches)

**Subject:** Recruiting tool idea - want your honest take

Hey [NAME],

You and I are in the same boat right now - trying to figure out the recruiting landscape for our girls.

Quick question: How are you finding schools to look at?

I keep running into the same problem - we know the big names (the ones on ESPN), our travel coaches know their networks, but there are 300+ D1 programs out there. Feels like we're missing schools that might be great fits just because we've never heard of them.

I'm thinking about building a tool that helps with discovery - deep program profiles, smart search (like "programs within X miles that fit Y criteria"), real info on culture and coaching philosophy. The stuff you can't easily Google.

**Would love your honest reaction:**

1. Is this actually a problem for you, or do you feel like you've got a good handle on the landscape?

2. What information do you wish existed that you can't find today?

3. How much time do you spend researching programs? Is it overwhelming or manageable?

4. Would you actually use something like this, or is word-of-mouth and camps enough?

Not trying to sell anything - just figuring out if this is worth building. Your perspective from the middle of it would help.

Let's grab coffee sometime and compare notes regardless.

## Usage Notes

**College Parent:** Best for someone 6-12+ months into their daughter's college career. They have perspective and no longer have skin in the game - more likely to be honest about what worked/didn't.

**Current Parent:** Best for someone in the 2026-2029 classes actively recruiting. They feel the pain daily but may also be defensive about their current approach.

**Personalization required:**
- [NAME] - Parent's first name
- [DAUGHTER] - Daughter's name
- [SCHOOL] - Where daughter plays (for college parent)
