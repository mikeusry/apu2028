# Softball Discovery Tool - Feedback Request

Caitlin,

Since our conversation in December about Ayn Parker's recruiting strategy, I've been thinking about a problem that keeps coming up - and I'd value your perspective given your experience coaching travel ball and guiding families through the recruiting process.

## The Problem

When families ask "what schools should we look at?", the answer usually involves the 20 programs everyone knows from ESPN plus whatever schools the travel coach has personal connections to. That leaves 280+ D1 programs that most families never hear about until it's too late.

Current services like SportsRecruits and NCSA help with exposure and messaging coaches, but none of them actually **educate** families about programs. They assume you already know where you want to go.

The result:
- Families making six-figure investments in travel ball with incomplete information
- Travel coaches getting asked the same questions repeatedly (and not having great answers for programs outside their network)
- Good players missing good fits because they didn't know a program existed

## The Concept

A discovery and education platform for softball programs. Not another profile site or recruiting service - a tool that helps families and coaches **learn** about programs the way you'd learn about them if you knew someone on staff.

**For families:**
- Deep program profiles with culture, coaching philosophy, recruiting patterns
- Smart search ("programs within 400 miles that develop contact hitters")
- "Programs similar to X" comparisons
- Living data on coaching changes and recruiting class status

**For travel coaches:**
- Quick answers when families ask about unfamiliar programs
- Time savings on repetitive research
- A tool to help guide families without pretending to know every program personally

## Your Input

Before going further, I want to gut-check this with people who live this world every day. A few questions:

1. **Is this a real problem?** Do families struggle with discovery, or is the current system (Google + word of mouth + showcases) good enough?

2. **Would coaches use it?** Would a tool like this help you advise families, or would it feel like stepping on your expertise?

3. **What's missing?** If something like this existed, what would make it actually useful vs. just another database?

4. **Who else should I talk to?** Any coaches or families who might give honest feedback?

No pitch here - genuinely trying to figure out if this is worth building. Your honest take would be valuable.
