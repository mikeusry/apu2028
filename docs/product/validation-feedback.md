## Caitlin Colvin | The Champions Gate
**Date:** December 29, 2025
**Role:** Recruiting Advisor, Former D1 Player (Ohio), Owner/Lead Instructor

### Response: STRONG VALIDATION + OFFER TO HELP

#### Key Quotes

> "I have actually mentioned this to multiple people both in the world and within the 'sports recruits' world about helping parents because I have gotten so many parents who came from other teams or programs who had no guidance on where to go and how to research the schools that could be a potential fit."

> "I do believe there is a huge need for guidance, decision making (ie. When to change your school focus), things to look for and making sure that kids are choosing the schools that fit their now and their future."

> "The Mid-Majors I believe would thrive in getting the players that fall between the cracks simply because they do not have the resources or knowledge to get them in front of the right people - both digitally and physically."

#### Validated Problem Points
- [x] Parents lack guidance on where to go and how to research
- [x] Kids choosing wrong schools for their "now AND future"
- [x] Mid-majors miss players who "fall through the cracks"
- [x] Gap in resources/knowledge for non-Top 25 programs

#### Potential Challenge Identified
> "The biggest push back I got was that people genuinely dont like to share information - organizations want to promote growth of sport and all athletes as long as those athletes are within their program"

**Translation:** Travel orgs may resist because hoarding info = competitive advantage. This is a distribution/adoption challenge, not a product problem.

#### Feature Suggestions
1. **Honest program representation** - Get coaches to provide real info about their programs
2. **Curated outreach content** - Help athletes send personalized emails, "not just another ChatGPT but something more curated and focused for each athlete"

#### Next Steps from Caitlin
- [x] Offered to be involved in building
- [x] Offered to reach out to other coaches for feedback

## Summary Scorecard

| Respondent | Role | Problem Valid? | Would Use? | Would Help Build? |
|------------|------|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Caitlin Colvin | Advisor/Coach | YES | YES | YES |
| Joe Walker | Travel Org | YES | YES | Likely (sons?) |
| Adrian Diaz | Team Coach | Pending | - | - |
| Matt Cronin | Parent (2029 Mid-Major) | Pending | - | - |
| Matt Thomas | Parent (2029 Power 4) | Pending | - | - |
| Matt Gillespie | College Parent (Portal) | Pending | - | - |
| Jeff Harvey | College Parent (Coaching Change) | Pending | - | - |

### Pending Parent Details

**Matt Cronin** - Daughter: Hannah Cronin (2029)
- Profile: Mid-major level player
- Goal: High academic school in New England
- Why valuable: Represents the "fall through the cracks" segment Caitlin mentioned. Academic fit + regional preference = complex search problem.

**Matt Thomas** - Daughter: Finley Thomas (2029)
- Profile: Power 4 catcher, projecting SEC/ACC
- Goal: Elite program placement
- Why valuable: Tests whether discovery is a problem even for elite prospects, or if they're already well-served by existing networks.

### Pending College Parent Details (Hindsight + Portal)

**Matt Gillespie** - Daughter: Madi Gillespie
- Path: Campbell → Georgia Southern (transfer portal)
- Why valuable: Lived the portal experience. Discovery problem happens TWICE - initial recruiting AND when you need to find a new home. What did they wish they knew?

**Jeff Harvey** - Daughter: Hannah Harvey
- School: Kennesaw State (Texas family)
- Context: Recent coaching change, considered portal but stayed
- Why valuable: Made the "stay or go" decision with incomplete info. What would have helped them evaluate other options when coaching changed?

## Emerging Themes

### Problem Validation
1. **Discovery gap is real** - Caitlin has seen it repeatedly with parents from other programs
2. **Mid-majors are underserved** - They need players but lack digital/physical reach
3. **Timing decisions matter** - "When to change your school focus" = real pain point
4. **Current system "doesn't work"** - Joe Walker's exact words
5. **Most coaches don't help** - Very few do what Joe does; kids miss opportunities
6. **Network gap** - Very few coaches have real networks to leverage

### Go-to-Market Signals
1. **Travel orgs may resist** - Info hoarding is competitive advantage (Caitlin)
2. **BUT org owners see the gap** - Joe runs Stars and says it doesn't work
3. **Coaches as distribution** - If coaches buy in, families follow
4. **Mid-major coaches = early adopters?** - They have the most to gain
5. **Data play is obvious** - Joe's been pushing his sons to build this for years

### Product Signals
1. **Curation > AI slop** - People want personalized, not generic
2. **Honest representation** - Trust/authenticity matters
3. **Decision support** - Not just info, but guidance on WHEN to act
4. **"Missing pieces"** - Joe has specific ideas (capture on call)
5. **Portal = second discovery moment** - When coaching changes or fit breaks, families need to re-discover options fast (Gillespie, Harvey)
