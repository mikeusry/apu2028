### Response: STRONG VALIDATION + OFFER TO HELP

#### Key Quotes

> "I have actually mentioned this to multiple people both in the world and within the 'sports recruits' world about helping parents because I have gotten so many parents who came from other teams or programs who had no guidance on where to go and how to research the schools that could be a potential fit."

> "I do believe there is a huge need for guidance, decision making (ie. When to change your school focus), things to look for and making sure that kids are choosing the schools that fit their now and their future."

> "The Mid-Majors I believe would thrive in getting the players that fall between the cracks simply because they do not have the resources or knowledge to get them in front of the right people - both digitally and physically."

#### Validated Problem Points
- [x] Parents lack guidance on where to go and how to research
- [x] Kids choosing wrong schools for their "now AND future"
- [x] Mid-majors miss players who "fall through the cracks"
- [x] Gap in resources/knowledge for non-Top 25 programs

#### Potential Challenge Identified
> "The biggest push back I got was that people genuinely dont like to share information - organizations want to promote growth of sport and all athletes as long as those athletes are within their program"

**Translation:** Travel orgs may resist because hoarding info = competitive advantage. This is a distribution/adoption challenge, not a product problem.

#### Feature Suggestions
1. **Honest program representation** - Get coaches to provide real info about their programs
2. **Curated outreach content** - Help athletes send personalized emails, "not just another ChatGPT but something more curated and focused for each athlete"

#### Next Steps from Caitlin
- [x] Offered to be involved in building
- [x] Offered to reach out to other coaches for feedback

## Emerging Themes

### Problem Validation
1. **Discovery gap is real** - Caitlin has seen it repeatedly with parents from other programs
2. **Mid-majors are underserved** - They need players but lack digital/physical reach
3. **Timing decisions matter** - "When to change your school focus" = real pain point

### Go-to-Market Signals
1. **Travel orgs may resist** - Info hoarding is competitive advantage
2. **Coaches as distribution** - If coaches buy in, families follow
3. **Mid-major coaches = early adopters?** - They have the most to gain

### Product Signals
1. **Curation > AI slop** - People want personalized, not generic
2. **Honest representation** - Trust/authenticity matters
3. **Decision support** - Not just info, but guidance on WHEN to act
