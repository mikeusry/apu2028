### Accomplished
1. **Coach Visits Dashboard Refinements** - Improved Flowbite-style table at `/coach-visits`
   - Filter buttons (All, Videos, 30s+ Only, College Towns)
   - Live toggle with pulsing indicator
   - Zebra striping, sticky headers
   - College town detection and highlighting

2. **Documentation Spider Scaffold** - Created `/docs/` structure:
   - `docs/index.md` - Entry point with quick links
   - `docs/recruiting/strategy.md` - Target schools, conference tiers
   - `docs/recruiting/wisdom.md` - 12 myths, 10 rules from Amelia Streuber
   - `docs/technical/coach-visits.md` - Dashboard documentation
   - `docs/technical/architecture.md` - Site structure

3. **Captured Recruiting Knowledge** from Notion:
   - Recruiting windows are REAL (Fall is prime)
   - Stats DO matter to coaches
   - If undersized, OVERWHELM with metrics
   - 3.74 GPA is a differentiator
   - Target schools: KSU, USC Upstate, Jacksonville State, Wofford, Charlotte (REALISTIC)
   - Safety schools: West Georgia, Georgia State, Mercer, Presbyterian, Furman

### Current Working State
- Build succeeds
- Dashboard functional at `/coach-visits`
- Documentation structure in place
- Ready for deployment

### Key Recruiting Insights
See `docs/recruiting/wisdom.md` for full details. Key points:
- Junior year (Fall 2026) is THE recruiting window
- Must work out 6x/week - table stakes for D1
- Use camps strategically - cut useless ones
- Develop one "can't ignore" tool (speed + contact hitting)

## Previous Session: December 11, 2025

### Accomplished
1. **Fixed CSS padding issues** - Replaced custom `@apply` classes with direct Tailwind utilities (`pt-8 pb-8`) on all component containers to fix desktop padding not rendering
2. **Integrated Cloudinary Video** - Replaced Gumlet iframe with native HTML5 video using Cloudinary delivery
   - Video: `Triple_Impact_Caymol_Premier_tjrmwn`
   - Auto-quality and auto-format optimization
   - Auto-generated poster thumbnail
3. **Updated Contact Section**
   - Added both parents: Mike Usry & Karin Usry with emails
   - Added both travel coaches: Joe Walker & Adrian Diaz with emails
   - Added YouTube link (@APU-2028)
4. **Updated About Section** - Added athletic family background (both parents UGA student-athletes)
5. **Pushed to GitHub** - Initial commit to mikeusry/apu2028

### Current Working State
- Build succeeds without errors
- All sections rendering correctly:
  - Hero with Cloudinary profile image
  - Video player with Cloudinary video
  - Skills breakdown grid
  - Stats & measurables table
  - Schedule/events section
  - About section with bio
  - Contact section with player/parents/coaches
  - Footer
- Ready for Vercel deployment

### Technical Notes
- **CSS Gotcha:** Don't use `@apply` for padding in `@layer components` - Tailwind JIT may not compile them. Use direct utility classes instead.
- **Cloudinary Video URL format:** `https://res.cloudinary.com/{cloud}/video/upload/{transforms}/{publicId}.mp4`
- **Poster from video:** Use `so_0` (start offset 0) to grab first frame as poster image

### No Blockers

### TODOs for Future Sessions
- [ ] Add more highlight videos as they become available
- [ ] Update schedule with actual tournament dates
- [ ] Add real stats when available
- [ ] Add more skill showcase images to SkillsGrid
- [ ] Consider adding a photo gallery section
- [ ] Set up custom domain (aynparkerusry.com) in Vercel
