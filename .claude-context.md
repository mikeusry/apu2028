### Accomplished
1. **Fixed CSS padding issues** - Replaced custom `@apply` classes with direct Tailwind utilities (`pt-8 pb-8`) on all component containers to fix desktop padding not rendering
2. **Integrated Cloudinary Video** - Replaced Gumlet iframe with native HTML5 video using Cloudinary delivery
   - Video: `Triple_Impact_Caymol_Premier_tjrmwn`
   - Auto-quality and auto-format optimization
   - Auto-generated poster thumbnail
3. **Updated Contact Section**
   - Added both parents: Mike Usry & Karin Usry with emails
   - Added both travel coaches: Joe Walker & Adrian Diaz with emails
   - Added YouTube link (@APU-2028)
4. **Updated About Section** - Added athletic family background (both parents UGA student-athletes)
5. **Pushed to GitHub** - Initial commit to mikeusry/apu2028

### Current Working State
- Build succeeds without errors
- All sections rendering correctly:
  - Hero with Cloudinary profile image
  - Video player with Cloudinary video
  - Skills breakdown grid
  - Stats & measurables table
  - Schedule/events section
  - About section with bio
  - Contact section with player/parents/coaches
  - Footer
- Ready for Vercel deployment

### Technical Notes
- **CSS Gotcha:** Don't use `@apply` for padding in `@layer components` - Tailwind JIT may not compile them. Use direct utility classes instead.
- **Cloudinary Video URL format:** `https://res.cloudinary.com/{cloud}/video/upload/{transforms}/{publicId}.mp4`
- **Poster from video:** Use `so_0` (start offset 0) to grab first frame as poster image

### No Blockers

### TODOs for Future Sessions
- [ ] Add more highlight videos as they become available
- [ ] Update schedule with actual tournament dates
- [ ] Add real stats when available
- [ ] Add more skill showcase images to SkillsGrid
- [ ] Consider adding a photo gallery section
- [ ] Set up custom domain (aynparkerusry.com) in Vercel
