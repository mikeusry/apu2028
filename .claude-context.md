### Accomplished

1. **Phase 1 Complete: UTM Tracking & Enhanced Events**
   - Full UTM parameter support (source, medium, campaign, content, term)
   - High-value event tracking: resume downloads, email clicks, form submissions
   - Section view tracking via Intersection Observer
   - UTM source analytics in dashboard (pills showing traffic sources)

2. **Coach Visits Dashboard Enhanced** (`/coach-visits`)
   - Filter buttons: All, Videos, High Value, 30s+ Only, College Towns
   - High-value events highlighted with purple left border
   - UTM source pills showing campaign attribution
   - Live toggle with pulsing indicator

3. **Notion CRM Integration Started**
   - Notion confirmed as CRM (not Supabase) - data already exists
   - Added email templates to Recruiting Home page from Rachel Coleman/Stars National
   - Documented Notion database IDs in marketing plan

4. **Email Templates Captured** (in Notion Recruiting Home)
   - First Email layout/structure
   - Twitter/Social Media Email
   - September 1 Prep Emails (DI contact date)
   - Camp/Clinic Protocol
   - Seasonal Emails (winter training, holidays)
   - Phone Call Requests (converting emails to calls)
   - Source: Rachel Coleman - Stars National / softballrecruiting.com

5. **Marketing Plan Created** - `docs/recruiting/marketing-recruiting-plan.md`
   - Phase 1: UTM + Events ✅ COMPLETE
   - Phase 2: Notion Integration (geo-matching, interaction logging)
   - Phase 3: Email Engine with tracked links
   - Phase 4: Lead capture + automation

### Architecture Decisions

- **Notion = CRM** (20+ schools, 20+ coaches already populated)
- **Vercel KV = Tracking** (pageviews, video plays, UTM events)
- **Hybrid approach** avoids Supabase migration, keeps parent-friendly editing

### Notion Database IDs (for API integration)

- Recruiting Home: `61af5757-ce21-4bb0-b38c-a6a14b5ace4c`
- Softball Schools: `1684d5cd-ab4b-80ac-8b7b-f54d31eb6653`
- College Contacts: `1684d5cd-ab4b-8066-ab48-ff0e97b1e0ca`
- Action Items: `1684d5cd-ab4b-80a7-91fa-e19a20f7ba4e`
- Softball Events: `1684d5cd-ab4b-8027-8ac5-c3f2d49b09d4`

### Current Working State
- Build succeeds
- UTM tracking fully functional
- Dashboard with filters and high-value highlighting
- Email templates in Notion
- Ready for Phase 2: Notion geo-matching integration

### Key Recruiting Insights
See `docs/recruiting/wisdom.md` for full details. Key points:
- Junior year (Fall 2026) is THE recruiting window
- Must work out 6x/week - table stakes for D1
- Use camps strategically - cut useless ones
- Develop one "can't ignore" tool (speed + contact hitting)

## Previous Session: December 11, 2025

### Accomplished
1. **Fixed CSS padding issues** - Replaced custom `@apply` classes with direct Tailwind utilities (`pt-8 pb-8`) on all component containers to fix desktop padding not rendering
2. **Integrated Cloudinary Video** - Replaced Gumlet iframe with native HTML5 video using Cloudinary delivery
   - Video: `Triple_Impact_Caymol_Premier_tjrmwn`
   - Auto-quality and auto-format optimization
   - Auto-generated poster thumbnail
3. **Updated Contact Section**
   - Added both parents: Mike Usry & Karin Usry with emails
   - Added both travel coaches: Joe Walker & Adrian Diaz with emails
   - Added YouTube link (@APU-2028)
4. **Updated About Section** - Added athletic family background (both parents UGA student-athletes)
5. **Pushed to GitHub** - Initial commit to mikeusry/apu2028

### Current Working State
- Build succeeds without errors
- All sections rendering correctly:
  - Hero with Cloudinary profile image
  - Video player with Cloudinary video
  - Skills breakdown grid
  - Stats & measurables table
  - Schedule/events section
  - About section with bio
  - Contact section with player/parents/coaches
  - Footer
- Ready for Vercel deployment

### Technical Notes
- **CSS Gotcha:** Don't use `@apply` for padding in `@layer components` - Tailwind JIT may not compile them. Use direct utility classes instead.
- **Cloudinary Video URL format:** `https://res.cloudinary.com/{cloud}/video/upload/{transforms}/{publicId}.mp4`
- **Poster from video:** Use `so_0` (start offset 0) to grab first frame as poster image

### No Blockers

### TODOs for Future Sessions
- [ ] Add more highlight videos as they become available
- [ ] Update schedule with actual tournament dates
- [ ] Add real stats when available
- [ ] Add more skill showcase images to SkillsGrid
- [ ] Consider adding a photo gallery section
- [ ] Set up custom domain (aynparkerusry.com) in Vercel
